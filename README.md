# ntroduction:
Using an ESP board to fetch data from a web interface.

# Requirements:
- 5 LEDs
- ESP32 board

# Implementation Steps:
1. First, I connected all the LEDs to the GUN pins on the ESP32 board.
2. For example, the green LED is connected to pin D32, the blue LED to pin D25, the yellow LED to pin D33, and the purple LED to pin D22.
3. The idea of the project is to fetch data from a web interface. When we can retrieve the values stored in the database for this interface, the LEDs will light up according to each value obtained.
